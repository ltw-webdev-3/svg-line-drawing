# SVG line drawing

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Export the SVG graphic from the `narwhal.ai` file—it’s already perfectly set up with layer & artboard names.
- Insert the SVG into an embed container, adding `.img-flex` onto the SVG.
  It’s better if the SVG isn’t `.embed-item` itself, but inside a `<div>` that is the `.embed-item`
- Add line drawing animations to the rainbow colours and the narwhal’s body.
- Add fade-in animations to the heading and the narwhal’s eye.
- The `index.html` file is already started and all the CSS files are already hooked up.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

### How line drawing animation works

Line drawing animation works by manipulating the stroke’s dashed line settings. Imagine a stroke in Illustrator that is a dashed line; now imagine the space between the dashes is the length of the stroke itself—it will appear that there is no stroke at all.

With `animation` we slowing reduce the `dashoffset` down to `0` causing the line to draw back into place.

There are two important properties:

- `stroke-dasharray` — This needs to be set to the length of the stroke itself.
- `stroke-dashoffset` — This also needs to be set to the length of the stroke initially, but then is animated to a length of `0` using `@keyframes`

You’ll end up with CSS that looks like this:

```css
.unicorn-horn {
  animation: …;
  stroke-dasharray: …px; /* The length of the stroke */
  stroke-dashoffset: …px; /* The length of the stroke */
}

/* Plus a @keyframes set that animates `stroke-dashoffset` back to `0` */
```

#### Finding the length of a stroke

Illustrator will give you the length of the stroke in pixels, to use in both `stroke-dasharray` & `stroke-dashoffset`, under the `Document Info` palette.

1. Go to `Window > Document Info`
2. In the “extra settings” menu of the palette, enable `Objects`
3. Select the element and it’s path information will show in the `Document Info` palette
